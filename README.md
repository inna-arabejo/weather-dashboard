# Weather Dashboard: Server-Side APIs

## Objective
Create a weather dashboard that retrieves weather data for cities using the OpenWeather API. By utilizing this third-party API, we will be able to access the data and functionality to forecast current and future weather conditions of multiple cities. The purpose of this weather dashboard will allow a traveller to plan a trip accordingly and teach you as a developer to retrieve data from another application's API.
